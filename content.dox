\section javascript_modules JavaScript Modules

The following javascript modules are used in the frontend:

\subsection annotated_dup_js annotated_dup.js
This module defines a JavaScript array called `annotated_dup`. This array is used to store data that maps namespaces and classes to their corresponding HTML documentation pages. This helps with generating table of contents.

\subsection classcom_bookstore_controller_home_controller_js classcom_bookstore_controller_home_controller.js
This module defines a JavaScript array called `classcom_1_1bookstore_1_1controller_1_1_home_controller`. This array contains a `home` function that is likely used to handle requests related to the home page, and contains the URL of the `HomeController` class.

\subsection clipboard_js clipboard.js
This module implements a "copy to clipboard" feature for code snippets. It utilizes the `navigator.clipboard` API to copy the content of code blocks when a user clicks the clipboard icon.

\subsection cookie_js cookie.js
This module provides utility functions for reading, writing, and erasing cookies. It includes functions for setting cookies, retrieving cookie values, and removing cookies.  It handles both localStorage/sessionStorage (for Chrome) and standard document.cookie for other browsers.

\subsection dir_*.js Directory Listing Modules
These modules contain JavaScript arrays that store directory structures and file paths within the project. They are automatically generated.

\subsection dynsections_js dynsections.js
This module provides functionality for dynamically toggling the visibility of sections on a web page.
